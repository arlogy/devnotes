# Comparing Strings in JavaScript

How do we compare strings in JavaScript?

- [Unicode equivalence](#using-a-normalization-function-for-unicode-equivalence)
- [Support for localization](#using-a-localization-aware-comparison-function)

## Using basic comparison operators

Basic comparison operators include `<`, `>`, `===` and others.

This approach works well for strings containing only ASCII characters. But what
about the other strings? Let's find out with the sample code below followed by
an explanation.

```javascript
(function() {
    // several versions of the same string
    const s1 = 'Ã±';
    const s2 = '\u00F1';
    const s3 = 'n\u0303';
    const s4 = '\u006E\u0303';
    console.log(s1, s2, s3, s4); // all versions share the same visual appearance

    // each version is equal to itself, this is logical, isn't it?
    console.log(s1 === s1, s2 === s2, s3 === s3, s4 === s4);

    // however, not all versions are equal...
    console.log(
        s1 === s2, s1 === s3, s1 === s4,
        s2 === s3, s2 === s4,
        s3 === s4
    );
})();
```

As can be seen in the example above, all the strings represent the same
information but are not equal. This is because JavaScript compares strings based
on their Unicode escape sequence, which can be inferred from the characters they
contain. Thus, the use of basic comparison operators is reliable only if one can
guarantee that the same string will never be encoded using different Unicode
escape sequences, or if one does not care about Unicode equivalence between
strings.

Usually we don't have to worry about Unicode equivalence when comparing strings,
so using the basic comparison operators should often be the developer's first
choice.

## Using a normalization function for Unicode equivalence

When Unicode equivalence is required, strings can first be normalized using
`String.prototype.normalize()`. The normalized versions can then be compared
using the basic comparison operators mentioned above.

However, before reading the documentation of the said normalization function,
one might want to read these introductory documents first.
- [Section 1.1 on Canonical and Compatibility Equivalence from Unicode Standard Annex #15](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Canon_Compat_Equivalence)
- [How to Check if Two Strings are Equal in JavaScript](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/string/javascript-string-equals/)

## Using a localization-aware comparison function

One can use `String.prototype.localeCompare()` to enable language-sensitive
string comparison.

Note that according to ECMAScript 5.1 (2011) specification, `String.prototype.localeCompare()`
[must correctly handle strings that are canonically equivalent according to the
Unicode standard](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-15.5.4.9).

> *The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit implementers to
encode additional information in the value, but the function is required to
define a total ordering on all Strings and to return 0 when comparing Strings
that are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode standard.*

So one can expect this function to support Unicode for canonical equivalence.
